          <p>
            Aspiring MERN Stack Developer with a good foundation in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, gained through self-learning and small
            courses. I am very passionate about web development, eager to apply my skills in real-world projects, and continuously learning to enhance
            my expertise. Highly motivated, adaptable, and excited to collaborate in a dynamic development environment. I am always ready to
            contribute and grow as a modern full-stack developer and also want to learn other trending techs and languages. Currently I am polishing
            my coding skills through building simple yet deep learning projects. Learning new things every single day. I have yet to decide which part
            of web development is good for me. So I have been spending much time on both frontend and backend. In my free time, I spend most of the
            time reading, especially light novels and manga/manhwa/manhua. I also love to watch movies, series and anime.

            <h4>E-Commerce</h4>
            <p>
              Developed a fully functional eCommerce web application using the MERN stack, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The app features user
              authentication, product listings, shopping cart, and order management. React with TypeScript ensured type safety and scalable component
              design, while TailwindCSS helped create a responsive and modern UI. The backend, developed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handled
              product data, user sessions, and secure checkout. This project enhanced my skills in full-stack development, API integration, and state
              management.

            <p>
              Built a Netflix clone using React and integrated it with The Movie Database (TMDb) API for fetching movie and TV show data. The app
              features a dynamic homepage with trending, top-rated, and genre-based content sections. It includes a responsive UI with horizontal
              scrollable carousels and a featured banner section. Users can view detailed movie information with poster, overview, and rating. This
              project enhanced my skills in API integration, component-based architecture, and modern React practices.

            <p>
              Developed a mobile expense calculator app using React Native, focused on tracking daily income and expenditures. The app features a
              clean UI, dynamic chart visualizations, and intuitive input forms. I used TypeScript for type safety, React Navigation for smooth screen
              transitions, and AsyncStorage for local data persistence. The app ensures real-time budget updates and provides detailed summaries. This
              project sharpened my skills in mobile development, performance optimization, and modern state management using Redux Toolkit.

              An OLX clone web application using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. The app allows users to post, browse, and delete
              classified ads in various categories. Firebase Authentication was used for secure user login and signup functionality. Real-time data
              storage and retrieval were handled using Firebase Firestore. This project helped me understand CRUD operations, user state management,
              and real-time database integration.

          <p>LevelX Academy</p>
          <em>2024 - 2025</em>
          <p>
            Started learning coding by attending a python online course. After completing an academic year at my teaching job, I enrolled in a coding
            academy called "LevelX" in order to speed up my learning. From there, I shifted my field to web development. I learnt the majority on my
            own, with only a little help from the Academy. After that, I left the academy and completed learning the MERN Stack fundamentals on my
            own.

          <p>
            Enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts in Sociology program at IGNOU to understand the society and human behavior. Through the course, I gained
            valuable insights into social structures, cultural dynamics, and psychological concepts. Although I made significant academic progress, I
            was unable to complete the course due to technical and communication challenges. I am trying to finish it as soon as possible.

            environment helped me grow intellectually and spiritually. I actively engaged in coursework, discussions, and language practice throughout
            my time at college. This experience strengthened my discipline and cultural understanding.
