        <h2>Overview</h2>
      </header>
      <p><strong>Fang Yuan</strong> is the protagonist of Reverend Insanity. Formerly a Scholar from Earth, he
        mysteriously transmigrated into the Gu World where he lived his first life for 500 years.</p>
      <p>He started as a common clan member before growing into a Gu Immortal and Sect Master of the Demonic Path. At
        the very end of this 500 Year Life, Fang Yuan was cornered by his foes and forced to use the power of his newly
        refined Spring Autumn Cicada to travel back in time to the days of his youth.</p>

      <p>In the Five Regions And Two Heavens, Fang Yuan became infamous for being one of the strongest demonic overlords
        of his time. He is someone who wreaks havoc wherever he goes in constant pursuit of Eternal Life, scheming and
        fighting against far more powerful enemies and ancient organizations.</p>

      <code>If the Spring and Autumn Cicada that I have just cultivated is effective, I shall still be a demon in my next life!</code>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Fang Yuan had plain facial features which did not make him stand out. However, after the events of Yi Tian
        Mountain he snatched the Sovereign Immortal Body from Shadow Sect which became his new physical body. This new
        physique was incredibly handsome with youthful traits that made him appear almost otherworldly.</p>

      <p>He usually wears simple white robes with wide sleeves. Initially shorter, his midnight black hair reaches all
        the way to his waist. Fang Yuan's most noticeable trait are his jet black eyes which seem to almost contain the
        dark abyss itself.</p>

      <code>To be a demon is to be merciless and cruel, a murderer and destroyer. There is no place in heaven or earth for such a thing – turning into an enemy to the world, still having to face the consequences</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="personality">
      <header>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
      </header>
      <p>He is a man of endless focus and perseverance. Despite being more powerful than his enemies many times, he
        never underestimates them and remains eternally vigilant when it comes to planning and executing his schemes,
        always calculating his chances realistically, expecting failures to happen and making contingencies for those
        possible failures.</p>
      <p>Fang Yuan truly only counts on himself and never fully relies on others when it matters, as he sees only his
        own strength as the greatest and most reliable assurance.</p>

      <p>He is a true demonic cultivator without moral restraints and his actions reflect that of a true opportunist,
        therefore, he is able to betray and sacrifice anyone at will, regardless of their supposed relationship, as long
        as this action benefits him and yields a greater gain. </p>
        
        <p>Compared to others influenced by compassion to not take
        action against weaker opponents, Fang Yuan is more than willing to take them on, only if the enemy is beyond
        Fang Yuan's strength or ability would he mindfully retreats</p>

      <p>To Fang Yuan, coldness, arrogance, humility, conceit, all of these are masks, they are tools for him to obtain
        profits. But because of this trait, he also causes many to distrust and be wary of him.</p>

      <code>In this life I hope to become the real moon, rising above the mountains and heavens, toying with the clouds and seas, following the ancient times and walk in the darkness above the various heavens.</code>

        <h2>Background</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Growing up in the Gu Yue Clan, Fang Yuan was highly praised for his early intelligence and was considered as a
        genius of the younger generation. He was able to start talking after only three months, able to walk after four
        and at five years of age, he was able to recite poetry. Those talents are the result of a transmigrated, mature,
        and intelligent soul that carried its experiences over. Some of the poetry he recited were Earth’s popular
        ancient poems.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately for him, at the annual awakening ceremony, he was only found to have C grade aptitude while his
        little brother Fang Zheng had an A grade aptitude. With this, he was immediately judged as worthless and trash
        in regards to his future cultivation prospects and as a result, the people of the clan ostracized him and
        treated him like scum. During this time he greatly suffered in the clan until finally deciding on leaving with a
        traveling caravan.</p>
