            Fang Yuan (古月方源, Gu Yue Fang Yuan, lit. Ancient Moon Fang Yuan)
            is the protagonist of Reverend Insanity.
          </li>

          <li>
            Formerly a Scholar from Earth, he mysteriously transmigrated into
            the Gu World where he lived his first life for 500 years.
          </li>

          <li>
            He started as a common clan member before growing into a Gu Immortal
            and Sect Master of the Demonic Path.
          </li>

          <li>
            At the very end of this 500 Year Life, Fang Yuan was cornered by his
            foes and forced to use the power of his newly refined Spring Autumn
            Cicada to travel back in time to the days of his youth.
          </li>

          <li>
            In the Five Regions And Two Heavens, Fang Yuan became infamous for
            being one of the strongest demonic overlords of his time.
          </li>

          <li>
            He is someone who wreaks havoc wherever he goes in constant pursuit
            of Eternal Life, scheming and fighting against far more powerful
            enemies and ancient organizations.
          </li>
        </ul>

            aspired to soar above the clouds. <br />

            A journey of cold winds and uncertainty, A lone traveler experiences
            a life of ups and downs.<br />

            A heart of steel forged from countless setbacks, A lifetime of
            effort to forge one sword.<br />

            Today, my sword aims beyond the clouds.<br />
