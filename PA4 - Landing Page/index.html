        <h2>Straw Hat Crew</h2>
        <p>
          The crew currently consists of ten members, being smaller than a
          typical pirate crew; when he first set sail, Luffy set a goal of
          gaining ten crewmates. They have one former member, Nefertari Vivi,
          who sailed with the crew from Reverse Mountain to the Arabasta
          Kingdom. Despite their small size, the Straw Hats are an extremely
          diverse group possessing a large variety of backgrounds. Their
          members' origins range from ordinary islanders and workers to bounty
          hunters, royalty, criminal gang members, and veteran pirates. Jinbe
          was once part of the renowned Seven Warlords of the Sea while Nami,
          Robin, and Franky were active enemies of the crew at certain points
          with the Arlong Pirates, Baroque Works and the Franky Family
          respectively. The crew consists of eight humans, one fish-man, and one
          animal with Devil Fruit-powered human intellect; of the humans, Sanji
          possesses superhuman modifications given to him at birth, Franky is a
          cyborg, and Brook possesses a skeleton body after being resurrected by
          a Devil Fruit power. They range in age from 17 (Chopper) to 90
          (Brook); the median age of the crew is 21.

        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
          Eiichiro Oda is a renowned Japanese manga artist best known as the
          creator of One Piece, the best-selling manga series in history. Born
          on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan, Oda harbored a passion for
          manga from a very young age, inspired notably by Akira Toriyama’s
          Dragon Ball and his fascination with pirate adventures sparked by the
          animated series Vicky the Viking. By the age of four, Oda had already
          decided to pursue a career as a manga artist, aiming to create
          captivating stories for readers around the world. Oda’s professional
          journey began in his late teens, when he won the prestigious Tezuka
          Award for his one-shot manga Wanted!, which helped him secure a
          position as an assistant to prominent manga artists like Nobuhiro
          Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin. During this period, Oda developed two
          pirate-themed one-shots called Romance Dawn, which eventually evolved
          into the story of One Piece. The series officially began serialization
          in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1997 and quickly gained immense popularity.
          Over the years, One Piece has sold over 520 million copies worldwide,
          making it a cultural and commercial phenomenon.
